The first is that multiple push buttons are often physically wired into the same detector input, making it impossible from the controller inputs to determine whether both push buttons are working, or just one. The second is due to the relatively infrequent calls, we have to rely upon a probabilistic approach to determining whether an input is failed because for some push buttons, there is so little demand it can be difficult to say with certainty from the data whether that the push button is indeed failed.</p>"
